-->A daemon is a long-running background process that answers requests for services. The term originated with Unix, but most operating systems 		use daemons in some form or another. 

-->You can use this to schedule activities, either as one-time events or as recurring tasks.

-->To schedule one-time only tasks with cron, use the at or batch command.

-->For commands that need to be executed repeatedly (e.g., hourly, daily, or weekly), you can use the crontab command.

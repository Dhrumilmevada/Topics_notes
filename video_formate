	-->A video codec is an electronic circuit or software that compresses or decompresses digital video. It converts uncompressed video to a 			compressed format or vice versa. In the context of video compression, "codec" is a concatenation of "encoder" and "decoder"â€”a device 		that only compresses is typically called an encoder, and one that only decompresses is a decoder.
